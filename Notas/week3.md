## Week 3 (8th October)

This week there were no code updates made , on my part, except for the encoding template and demo.
The majority of time was spent researching the generalised MLSAG, meetings and preparing the demo.
 The goal of completing the bulletproof implementation, will be pushed onto the week commencing 15th October.
