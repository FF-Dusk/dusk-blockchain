- When generating an ID for a listener, it is very important that the upper bound for this number is quite high. As there are quite a few consensus components, we need to be absolutely sure to avoid collisions - since collisions will end up causing messages being delivered to the completely wrong component. When the random number generation was updated in order to address gosec lints, the max bound chosen was 32, and this ended up causing lots of early consensus stalls as messages would just end up lost. The issue was logged [here](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain/issues/701) and fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain/pull/650).
