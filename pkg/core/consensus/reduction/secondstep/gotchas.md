- Caution should be taken when deciding on what terms the timeout should be increased. A bug was caught where, on completely valid results, the timeout would still increase as the node was not part of the agreement committee. The issue was logged [here](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain/issues/700) and fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain/pull/650).
