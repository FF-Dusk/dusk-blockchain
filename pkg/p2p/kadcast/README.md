Kadcast Peer
============

`p2p/kadcast` package provides an embedded gRPC interface that allows the Node to communicate with the actual [Kadcast Peer](https://github.com/dusk-network/kadcast) that lives within [Rusk](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk) and exposes a gRPC server for bidirectional communication.
