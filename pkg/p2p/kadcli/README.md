Kadcast gRPC client
=============

`p2p/kadcli` package provides an embedded gRPC client that allows the Node to communicate with the [Kadcast Peer](https://github.com/dusk-network/kadcast) that lives within [Rusk](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk) and exposes a gRPC server for bidirectional communication.
